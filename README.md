In simple terms, cryptography is the application of selected processes for encoding data so that the information can be stored and transmitted securely. The Microsoft  `CryptoAPI` allows developers to build cryptographic security into their applications by providing a flexible set of functions to encrypt or digitally sign data. You can use cryptography to achieve many security requirements, including:

- Ensuring secrecy by coding sensitive files so that an interloper cannot understand them;
- Guaranteeing secure communications even though the transmission media is not secure;
- Verifying the origin of messages and data using digital signatures.

The fundamental cryptographic operations supported by the  `CryptoAPI` are encryption, decryption, and signing. Encryption is somewhat like controlled fragmentation: the data is there, but itâ€™s scattered according to the encryption rules. Decryption is simply the inverse of encryption, where the encryption rules are reversed to reassemble the data. Digital signing is analogous to physically hand-signing a document, but with one significant improvement: it is very, very difficult to forge a digital signature.

The main implementation is done in  _CryptographyExt.h_  and  _CryptographyExt.cpp_  files, as follows:
- `bool GetChecksumBuffer(ALG_ID nAlgorithm, LPBYTE lpszOutputBuffer, DWORD& dwOutputLength, LPBYTE lpszInputBuffer, DWORD dwInputLength);` computes hash code for the given binary buffer, using the specified algorithm;
- `bool GetChecksumString(ALG_ID nAlgorithm, CString& strResult, CString strBuffer);` computes hash code for the given  `CString`, using the specified algorithm;
- `bool GetChecksumFile(ALG_ID nAlgorithm, CString& strResult, CString strPathName);` computes hash code for the given file, using the specified algorithm;
- `bool EncryptBuffer(ALG_ID nAlgorithm, LPBYTE lpszOutputBuffer, DWORD& dwOutputLength, LPBYTE lpszInputBuffer, DWORD dwInputLength, LPBYTE lpszSecretKey, DWORD dwSecretKey);` encrypt the given binary buffer, using the specified algorithm;
- `bool EncryptFile(ALG_ID nAlgorithm, CString strOutputName, CString strInputName, LPBYTE lpszSecretKey, DWORD dwSecretKey);` encrypt the given file, using the specified algorithm;
- `bool DecryptBuffer(ALG_ID nAlgorithm, LPBYTE lpszOutputBuffer, DWORD& dwOutputLength, LPBYTE lpszInputBuffer, DWORD dwInputLength, LPBYTE lpszSecretKey, DWORD dwSecretKey);` decrypt the given binary buffer, using the specified algorithm;
- `bool DecryptFile(ALG_ID nAlgorithm, CString strOutputName, CString strInputName, LPBYTE lpszSecretKey, DWORD dwSecretKey);` decrypt the given file, using the specified algorithm;
- Helper function for secret key:  `CString GetComputerID();`.
